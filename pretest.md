## <b> Pre-test</b>
#### Please attempt the following questions

<br>
Q 1. What’s remain same in series connected roadways?<br>
a. Pressure<br>
<b>b. Quantity of air</b><br>
c. Resistance<br>
d. None of the above<br><br>

Q 2. Which of the following is true about series connected roadways?<br>
a. P = P<sub>1</sub>+P<sub>2</sub>+P<sub>3</sub>+…………………………+P<sub>n</sub> <br>
b. R<sub>equ</sub>  =  R<sub>1</sub>+ R<sub>2</sub>+ R<sub>3</sub>+………………………………+R<sub>n</sub><br>
c. Q = Q<sub>1</sub>+Q<sub>2</sub>+Q<sub>3</sub>+……………………………………Q<sub>n</sub> <br>
<b>d. Both a & b</b><br>

Q 3. In general, which connection offer more resistance if number of individual resistance is same?<br>
<b>a. Series</b><br>
b. Parallel <br>
c. Both offer same equivalent resistance<br>
d. None of the above <br>

Q 4. Which of the following is not a advantage of series connected airways?<br>
a. Series circuits are simple circuits as there are no splits<br>
b. There is a lesser need for Ventilation Control Devices (VCD) in particular regulators<br>
c. There are less chances of leakage of air<br>
<b>d. Since the fresh air is not supplied to each district, it results in poor working conditions</b><br>

Q 5. Which of the following is not a advantage of parallel splitting  airways?<br>
a. The overall mine resistance is lower, thus air flows with much ease<br>
b. In case of fires/explosions in one panel, the production/operations in other panel is not affected<br>
<b>C. They are more susceptible to leakage or recirculation</b><br>
d. They provide fresh air at every working place of a district<br>
